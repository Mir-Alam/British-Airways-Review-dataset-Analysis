British Airways Review Analysis ✈️🛫

Welcome to my British Airways Review Analysis project! 🎉

In this project, I analyzed a British Airways review dataset using Power BI to uncover valuable insights about aircraft ratings, popular routes, and other key factors. The goal was to examine how different aircraft are rated by passengers, the most common routes by aircraft type, and how ratings change over time.
